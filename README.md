# BackGroundCC

BackgroundCC is a Linux user-space background data transfer service built to move bulk, delaytolerant data while keeping latency low for foreground network traffic. It is a user-space re derivation of LEDBAT++. The focus is on making sure background transfers stay effectively invisible to interactive applications like web browsing, SSH, video calls, gaming, or remote desktops. BackgroundCC uses spare bandwidth when the network is idle and yielding smoothly and conservatively as soon as other traffic starts competing for capacity.

The congestion control logic in BackgroundCC is delay-based and inspired by LEDBAT and LEDBAT++, as described in RFC 6817 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6817) and the LEDBAT++ experimental research draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-iccrg-ledbat-plus-plus/). 

Instead of relying mainly on packet loss, the sender continuously measures round-trip time (RTT) and keeps a dynamic baseline to estimate queueing delay. Rate adaptation is handled by a target-based control loop that increases the sending rate when queueing delay is low and backs off early as delay approaches or crosses the target. Packet loss is treated as a secondary safety signal rather than the main driver of congestion control.

BackgroundCC adopts several key ideas from LEDBAT++, including reduced gain, multiplicative decrease under sustained congestion, periodic slowdowns to refresh baseline delay estimates, and constrained startup behavior. Packet transmission is strictly time-paced to avoid micro-bursts that could temporarily fill queues or distort delay measurements. The system runs entirely in user space and uses UDP, with application-level mechanisms for reliability, sequencing, and retransmission.

Beyond following the core principles of LEDBAT and LEDBAT++, BackgroundCC adds practical engineering choices to make it work better on real networks. RTT samples are filtered to deal with jitter from Wi-Fi, scheduling noise, and ACK compression, and congestion decisions are based on persistent delay trends rather than individual samples. When delay measurements become unreliable, the controller falls back to a conservative safe mode that prioritizes protecting foreground traffic. These additions are implementation-level extensions aimed at keeping the system stable and predictable under noisy and heterogeneous network conditions.
